# Contributing

First, thanks for wanting to contribute. You’re awesome! :heart:

## Questions

Use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) with the tag `pghero`.

## Feature Requests

Create an issue. Start the title with `[Idea]`.

## Issues

Think you’ve discovered an issue?

1. Search existing issues to see if it’s been reported.
2. Try the `master` branch to make sure it hasn’t been fixed.

```rb
gem "pghero", github: "ankane/pghero"
```

If the above steps don’t help, create an issue. Include:

- Detailed steps to reproduce
- Complete backtraces for exceptions

## Pull Requests

Fork the project and create a pull request. A few tips:

- Keep changes to a minimum. If you have multiple features or fixes, submit multiple pull requests.
- Follow the existing style. The code should read like it’s written by a single person.

Feel free to open an issue to get feedback on your idea before spending too much time on it.
